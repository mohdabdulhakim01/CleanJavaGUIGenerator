# CleanJavaGUIGenerator
Simple Project to generate Java GUI based on assignment assessment given


------------
Note
------------
 This project is to build simple functional GUI java app for my class java assignment. The assignment need you to write java gui which is super long code and i will say I'm tired writing the java code. So i built this tool to generate the java gui code for whatever java gui assignment code needed. But this tool is not stable (no update will happen since I'm finish the study already ) and doesn't monitor if your java code will run like intended since this tool just generate the smaller component and mix it together, compile and run it for you. It require you to understand java gui first to use this tool. this tool more like autocomplete rather than designer.
 
 But if you happen to like this project and want to use the code for further customisation or for your own project, feel free to use it :D
